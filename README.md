# Bandify
This simple Python program will generate a band name based on the city you grew up in and your pet's name.

# Usage
The program will:

- Print a greeting<br>
- Ask for the city you grew up in and store it in the city variable<br>
- Ask for your pet's name and store it in the pet variable<br>
- Concatenate the city and pet variables to generate a band name and print it<br>

# Improvements
Some potential improvements for this program:

- Ask for more inputs to generate more creative band names
- Handle invalid input (e.g. empty strings) gracefully
- Save the generated band name to a text file
- Allow the user to generate multiple band names<br>
### Hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
